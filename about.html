            <p><img src="./images/me.jpg" title="A bit outdated photo of me. The only difference is that now I have a beard." /> My name is Łukasz Czyżykowski (if you ever meet me in person, just saying Lucas is just fine). I was born and grew up in Wrocław, Poland, but for last couple years I’ve been living in Barcelona, Spain.</p>
<p>The web becomes more and more important part of our daily lives. It helps us to learn new things. It helps us to communicate with each other. It also helps us to do our work. It become indispensable.</p>
<p>The technologies behind web changed a lot and I feel lucky to be able to witness it firsthand. The amazing possibilities enables us to build more and more sophisticated solutions.</p>
<p>I’m grateful that I’ve been able to build a lot of applications for the web. The medium, although challenging at times, is rewarding. In the end making people’s lives at least a little bit easier is an amazing experience.</p>
