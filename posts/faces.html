		<section id="post-body">
            <p>I started using the Internet during the high school. In the beginning, every email address in my address book belonged to someone I knew personally. I could easily picture people behind the strings of letters. But this state of the affairs didn’t last long.</p>
<p>Soon I started venturing outside of the friendly walls of my school. In the beginning, I was digging through resources published by the local university (where much later I would end up studying). There it was still possible to find the professors who published things online and by that fact keep everything online humane, attached to real people.</p>
<p>But when I ended up outside of those two friendly institutions there was no way (at least back then) to find out how those people looked. It had left me with a certain feeling that something was missing. I couldn’t connect various email addresses and nicknames with faces. And because of that, the internet lost its humanness.</p>
<p>Even now, when more and more people have photos of them published online it can take some digging through to find how such and such looks like. To connect a human face to a blog post or a comment. It’s not that I really care how people look, just that I want to have the connection to something humane, something real. My brain is trying to use the faculties evolved for millennia to understand the world.</p>
<p>That’s why the first thing I go when stumbling on a new blog is about me section. I hope to find there a face which I can connect with the author. It’s also why I crave the photos of any team I’m interacting with.</p>
<p>A photo is a small substitute for meeting in person.</p>
