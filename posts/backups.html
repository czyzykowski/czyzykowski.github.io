		<section id="post-body">
            <p>It was April 26th, 1999. I just got back from school and, as always, the first thing I did was to turn on my computer. It started normally, but soon I noticed that something was wrong. Instead of the normal sound of the machine booting up, there was silence.</p>
<p>I tried pushing the power button again. And again. And again.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>I checked inside of the computer for signs of obvious problems but everything seemed fine. Nothing burned and all cables at the right places.</p>
<p>With the help of my parents, we took it to the local repair shop. There we got a quick diagnose. The motherboard was bricked and all the data on the disk was lost.</p>
<p>Several years later I decided to upgrade hard disk in my laptop to SSD. It was still a novel thing and there were a lot of opinions about theirs reliability, but one thing was common if something goes wrong with the disk you lose access to all the data.</p>
<p>Because I was determined not to keep all my data safe I decided to keep regular backups. I had my old laptop disk lying around so I used it as a hot spare. Once a week I would clone my SSD disk to it. That way if anything happened I could just swap the disks and continue using my machine.</p>
<p>Once I had regular backups of my laptop, a computer which was crucial to my job, I started thinking about the rest of my data and what would be the best way to protect it.</p>
<p>I first reached for <a href="https://www.jungledisk.com/">JungleDisk</a>. Back then it was a new solution which offered to store data in Amazon S3. All not critical (but not too big) files went into S3.</p>
<p>Additionally, I got myself another external disk to make incremental backups. For that Time Machine works just fine. I come across small issues when I run out of space on the disk, but recently it has been running without any problems.</p>
<p>Recently I switched from JungleDisk to <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap</a>. The main reason being that JungleDisk tends to be CPU heavy while doing backups and I just got tired of my computer being unusable. With tarsnap, it’s not a problem. Plus it has other advantages.</p>
<p>To be exact I use tarsnap with <a href="https://github.com/alexjurkiewicz/acts">acts</a> which implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_rotation_scheme#Grandfather-father-son">grandfather-father-son</a> backup rotation schema. To make it work on OS X I had to modify acts a bit, but because it’s a bash script, it wasn’t that complicated (I should contribute my changes back to the acts project).</p>
<p>The last piece of software I use for backups is <a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/">git-annex</a>. It’s a versatile piece of software. My main use case is ensuring that my collection of photos is safe. I keep one copy in S3 and another on an external drive. git-annex takes care of ensuring that every file is stored in at least two places.</p>
<p>So far I didn’t have to test full recovery from my online backups. I hope I will never have to. I was able to get back to a lot or corrupted file. Regardless of that, I feel safer about my data.</p>
<p>By the way, the reason for my computer losing all the data, back in 1999 was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIH_(computer_virus)">Chernobyl virus</a>. A lot of people got affected and it was quite a big news. (Knowing a great deal more about computers and reading that Wikipedia article I know that I could have recovered my data. Only if I knew. But then I could have missed such a valuable lesson.)</p>
